 	To reach point in BBD I go Root -> B Child 1 -> BB child 1 -> BBD child 3 


 CalcForces:
	 Something that removes this value from every vector in X.
	 I will need code which splits the data into bite size chunks to feed into the registers
	 I Should first vectorise the problem
	 From that I could hold a vector of those coordinates, holding enough that maxes out the registers.
	 fill rest with zero if I cant fit enough.
